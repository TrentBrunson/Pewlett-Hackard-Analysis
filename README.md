# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
------
### Project Overview
###### Pewlett-Hackard is facing a potential silver-tsunami and wants to proactively manage resources.  They want to identify roles that are retiring and identify resources for a part-time (consultant) mentorship program to develop the next generation of leaders in the enterprise.

### Resources
Used PostgreSQL to build a database and complete analysis for the required tasks.  In Preparation for this, I create an Entity Relationship Diagram with Quick Database Diagrams (https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com)
